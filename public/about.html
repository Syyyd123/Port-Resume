<h1>Hey! This is a little bit about me!</h1>

<p>
  Hey there! I’m a Business Analyst 
  with a knack for solving problems and 
  bringing ideas to life. I’ve worked in 
  EdTech and UX/UI design, where I’ve honed 
  my skills in gathering requirements, creating 
  PRDs, and mapping out user flows for school management 
  systems and CRM platforms. I’m all about making things 
  work smoothly—whether it’s designing features, optimizing 
  processes, or integrating the latest tech like AI and 
  automation tools.
</p>

<p>
  With solid experience in HubSpot, 
  data analysis, and data modeling, 
  I’m great at bridging the gap between 
  tech and business teams. Collaboration is 
  my superpower, and I love working with cross-functional 
  teams to deliver solutions that are not just functional 
  but also user-friendly.
</p>

<h2>When I’m not analyzing workflows or writing requirements, you’ll find me:
